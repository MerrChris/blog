I am a **Postdoctoral researcher** in the [Machine Learning Group](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/anc/research/machine-learning) at the University of Edinburgh under the supervision of prof. [Amos Storkey](https://www.bayeswatch.com/). Previously I have been an intern at [Snapchat](https://www.snapchat.com) supervised by dr. [Edward Rosten](https://www.edwardrosten.com/index.html) (inventor of the [FAST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Features_from_accelerated_segment_test) algorithm), and a PhD student in robotics and machine learning at Plymouth University with prof. [Angelo Cangelosi](https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/angelo.cangelosi.html) and [Giorgio Metta](https://www.iit.it/people/giorgio-metta). I am particularly interested in **Deep Learning** and **Reinforcement Learning**, and I am currently working on efficient learning (few-shot) integrating deep neural networks with Bayesian methods. In my opinion the brain is a complex and fascinating piece of meat that cannot be explained without an interdisciplinary approach. For this reason I studied machine learning, robotics, neuroscience and psychology. My long term goal is to add some pieces to the puzzle :-)

You can find a short **curriculum** on [my personal page](https://mpatacchiola.github.io) and an update list of my **publications** on my [Google Scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=L4GcSrsAAAAJ&hl=en).
