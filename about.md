I am a Cognitive Scientist in love with Artificial Intelligence and Robotics. At the moment I am finishing my PhD in Robotics and Computational Modelling at Plymouth University (UK). In my opinion the brain is a complex and fascinating piece of meat which cannot be explained without an interdisciplinary approach. For this reason I studied computer science, psychology, robotics and neuroscience. My goal is to add some pieces to the puzzle through models of cognitive functions which can be implemented in those complex machines we call robots.
