I am a **Postdoctoral researcher** in the [Machine Learning Group](http://www.anc.ed.ac.uk/machine-learning/) at the University of Edinburgh. Previously I have been an intern at [Snapchat](https://www.snapchat.com), and a PhD student in robotics and machine learning at Plymouth University. I am particularly interested in **Deep Learning** and **Reinforcement Learning**, and I worked in applications that span from cognitive modelling in human-robot interactions to disentanglement of latent representations in autoencoders. In my opinion the brain is a complex and fascinating piece of meat that cannot be explained without an interdisciplinary approach. For this reason I studied machine learning, robotics, neuroscience and psychology. My long term goal is to add some pieces to the puzzle :-)

You can find a short **curriculum** and my **pubblications** on [my personal page](https://mpatacchiola.github.io).
