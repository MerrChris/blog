Today I was looking for some robust/fast way to **track hands** in OpenCV. At the beginning I turned my attention to classifiers such as: Haar cascade, Convolutional Neural Networks, SVM, etc. Unfortunately there are two main problems with classifiers: slinding windows and datasets.

1. To classify parts of an image it is often used a standard approach called **sliding window**. A sliding window is a window of predefined size that is moved over an image and which content is given as input to the classifier. If you have a picture containing human faces and you want to identify in which part of the image the faces are then you have to use a sliding window. This approach is widely used in computer vision but it has a serious drawback: speed (in terms of computational efficiency). Since we do not know the size of the face we have to move windows of different size over the input image. This is time/resources consuming. A Region Of Interest (ROI) can be used to define a subframe of the input image to use as input feature. This solution introduce more problems, defining the position of the ROI.

2. Another problem when you want to implement a classifier is to find **datasets** which can be used in the training phase. OpenCV has an Haar calssifier for hand detection but it has been trained on a limited dataset and it recognises hands in predefined poses. I tried to use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for recognising open hands but I had the same problem, very few datasets available.

Given this two problems, what to do? 

One possibility was the **Histogram Backprojection** algorithm. This algorithm was proposed by Swain and Ballard in their article [Indexing via color histograms](http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-77225-2_13). How does the algorithm work? We start with an input image and an object to track (let's say our hand). Next we take a subframe from the image, this subframe is often called `template` and it corresponds to the object we want to track (or a significant part of it).

Given the input image and the template the algorithm creates a output image of the same size of the input but with a single channel. Each pixel in the output image corresponds to the probability of that pixel of belonging to the reference object.
